This is my first attempt at learning machine learning by predicting football results. 

So far stats can be gathered by several scripts from [https://www.openligadb.de/]. 
ml_data.php gatheres structured data for the python script to process, which predicts outcomes for this seasons games,
check_bets.php checks them against the games so far and displays the next matchday bets.
